See the [component page](http://bendavis78.github.io/paper-date-picker/) for 
full documentation.

## Example usage:

Default picker:

```html
<paper-date-picker></paper-date-picker>
```

Setting the initial date to April 20, 2015:

```html
<paper-date-picker date="2014-04-20"></paper-date-picker>
```

You may also specify a minimum and/or maximum date allowed in this picker using the same date notation:
```html
<paper-date-picker min-date="2014-04-20" max-date="2015-04-20"></paper-date-picker>
```

If you include this element as part of `paper-dialog`, use the class
`"paper-date-picker-dialog"` on the dialog in order to give it proper styling.

```html
    <paper-action-dialog id="dialog" modal class="paper-date-picker-dialog">
      <paper-date-picker id="datePicker"></paper-date-picker>
      <div class="buttons">
        <paper-button dialog-dismiss>Cancel</paper-button>
        <paper-button dialog-confirm>OK</paper-button>
      </div>
    </paper-action-dialog>
```
