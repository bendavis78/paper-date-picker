See the [component page](http://bendavis78.github.io/paper-date-picker/) for 
full documentation.

## Examples:

Default picker:

```html
<paper-date-picker></paper-date-picker>
```

Setting the initial date to April 20, 2015:
```html
<paper-date-picker date="April 20, 2015"></paper-date-picker>
```

You may also specify a minimum and/or maximum date allowed in this picker using
the same date notation:
```html
<paper-date-picker min-date="April 1, 2015" max-date="June 30, 2015"></paper-date-picker>
```

If you include this element as part of `paper-dialog`, use the class
`"paper-date-picker-dialog"` on the dialog element in order to give it proper
styling:
```html
<paper-dialog id="dialog" class="paper-date-picker-dialog" modal
  on-iron-overlay-closed="dismissDialog">
  <paper-date-picker id="picker" date="[[date]]"></paper-date-picker>
  <div class="buttons">
    <paper-button dialog-dismiss>Cancel</paper-button>
    <paper-button dialog-confirm>OK</paper-button>
  </div>
</paper-dialog>
```
